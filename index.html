        <p>The City of San Fernando is situated in the mountainous area at almost the mid-section of La Union along the China
            Sea.
            It was founded in 1786 and made the “cabecera” or provincial capital on the same day that La Union became province
            in
            1850. During the Spanish times, a settlement was a place where there were about 200 families.</p>
